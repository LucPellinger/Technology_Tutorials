## ‚öôÔ∏è Tips for Efficient Terminal Use

- Use `tab` to auto-complete file and folder names.
- Use `Ctrl + R` to search your command history.
- Combine commands with `&&` or `;` for more powerful workflows.

## üå≥ Viewing Directory Structure with `tree`

The `tree` command displays a visual representation of directory structures.

### Basic usage
```bash
tree path/target_directory_name
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If tree is not installed, install it with:

sudo apt install tree   # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install tree       # macOS (with Homebrew)
```


- Limit depth of folders displayed
```bash
tree -L 2
```

- List files with entered pattern
```bash
tree -P "*.txt"
```

- Show hidden files
```bash
tree -a
`or` 
tree --all
```

- List directories only.
```bash
tree -d
`or` 
tree --dirs-only
```

- Show file sizes: Print the size of each file along with the name.
```bash
tree -s
```

- Print the date of the last modification time for the file listed. 
```bash
tree -D
```

- Prints the full path prefix for each file. 
```bash
tree -f
`or` 
tree --full-path
```
